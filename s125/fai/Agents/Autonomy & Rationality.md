### Autonomy Lemma
$$
\begin{gather}
\text{if agent A has properties: pragmiatic, generalize and specialize, goal-driven, can change its mind} \\
 \text{then A is autonomous}
\end{gather}

$$

### Rationality Lemma
$$
\begin{gather}
\text{If an agent is rational} \implies Task-Environment -Complete (TE-Complete)*
\end{gather}
$$
$$
\begin{gather}

\end{gather}
$$
	
	**Task Environment-Complete is when there is a specified environment for the agent

### The properties of TE-Complete
#### PEAS:  
	performance
	environment
	actuators
	sensors

Therefore,

$$
\text{an Autonomous Rational Agent is a a bijective function from "Autonomy Lema" to TE-Complete}
$$
