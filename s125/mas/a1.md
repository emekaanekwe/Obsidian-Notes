| 1. A Q-table must be made                                                                                | qt(x)           | np.zeros(n)       |
| 1.1 the q-table must be of size n x n where n is the number of rows f the grid                           | qt(n * n)       | np.zeros(n,n)     |
| 1.2 the q-table must include all possible actions, and a check of whether the agent has reached its goal | qt(n * n, 4, 2) | np.zeros(n,n,2,4) |
