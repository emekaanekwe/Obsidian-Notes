value_precede_chain([0,1,2,3], [0..2, 1..3, 4..5])

|       |     |       |     |     |     |
| ----- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0     | 1   | 2     | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| **a** | a   | a     | a   |     |     |
|       | b   | **b** | b   |     |     |
|       |     |       |     | c   | c   |
| d     | d   | d     | d   |     |     |
this is about the *placmeent of the values and not the chars*
	thus the chars are more like attributes of the vals, i.e. decision variables.

predicate value_precede_chain(array [$$X] of $$E: c, array [$Y] of var $E: x)
