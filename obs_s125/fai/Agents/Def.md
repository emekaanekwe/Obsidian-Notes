an object that can perform actions to modify future percepts (a thing that is perceived) with the goal of getting useful information from some architecture. 
		A function from histories to actions:

$$
\begin{array}
\; \text{for a set of percepts } p \; \epsilon \; P \; \text{and a set of actions} \; a \; \epsilon \; A, \\ \text{an agent is a bijective function} \; \\
  p \implies a
\end{array}
$$
Also written as:
$$
f: P*\implies A
$$
