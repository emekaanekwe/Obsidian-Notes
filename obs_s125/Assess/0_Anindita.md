#### Side Notes

 **Why This Works:**  
- **Breakfast** → Boosts metabolism, reduces evening cravings.  
- **Balanced meals** → Keeps blood sugar stable (no energy crashes).  
- **Walking** → Improves insulin sensitivity (helps weight loss).  

**Science-Backed Rationale:**  
1. Protein at Breakfast: Reduces evening cravings ([Leidy et al., 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23446906/)).  
2. Low-GI Carbs: Brown rice/quinoa stabilize blood sugar ([Jenkins et al., 2002](https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/25/11/2022)).  
3. Walking Post-Meal: Lowers postprandial glucose ([DiPietro et al., 2013](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/36/10/3262/37844)).
