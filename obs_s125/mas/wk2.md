# Macroscopic Deterministic Models

there is somewhat of an issue regrading the lecture material and the reading material. A discrepancy, if you will. 
I cannot seem to find certain (doesn't apply to all) key terms from the slides that link in some clear way back to the literature. So I have some options:
1. Continue reading the prescribed literature and assume that it will make sense over time
2. Turn to literature outside of class that specifically dicussess the topic covered
3. A combination of 1& 2.

If I were to choose 3, the study time could almost double, depending on the weight of the found readings.

Option 1 seems more of a "shot in the dark", as there is no way to track if my learning is going in the direction of the assignments

Option 2 runs the risk of me losing possibly important information because I will be referring less to the prescribed reading and more to what I find.

**So far**: Option 3 seems like the best course of action, but it is the most costly. So to minimize the cost, it would be wise to choose 1-2 resources that are directly relevant to the lectures, and use only those.
