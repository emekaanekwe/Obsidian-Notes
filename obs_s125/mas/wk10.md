Nash Eq: 
is a stable strategy profile where no player can improve unilaterally.

A strategy proﬁle s = (s 1 , . . . , s n ) is a Nash equilibrium if, for all agents i, s i is a best response to s −i .

mixed nash:
mixed strategy: more than one action is played with positive probability`

`mixed nash: best reponse picked based on player's Pr distribution`

the issue is that min(max(f(x))) is often unsolvable, so we instead take z', an auxiallary formula to constrain the problem.

for calculating the linar program, **the goal is to minimize the loss of the column player**

$$
\forall i: z'- \sum_{j=1}{a_{i,j} * y_j} >= 0
$$

a_i,j = outcome for action in i,j matrix of row player
y_i,j = probability outcome for column player action

**It's important to know whether the game is fair**

Note: you should be able to write the down the constraints of the problem and *formulate* the linear program (write out, not solve necessarily)

For at least one strategy that is equal to 0

Monte Carlo method can be used to **check if the game is fair**
