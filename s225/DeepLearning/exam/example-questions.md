Help me make a math cheat sheet for all the important mathematical concepts/formulas and numeric examples, which will help me prepare for the exam. --- I have come up with some concepts below, but it is not well organized, and some concepts are unclear or maybe wrong. --- help me fix this and fill in any gaps. --- Also check if they are in the correct logical order ---
