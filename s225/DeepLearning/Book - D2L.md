# Ch 1

Deep learning is differentiated from classical approaches
principally by the set of powerful models that it focuses on. These models consist of many
successive transformations of the data that are chained together top to bottom, thus the
name deep learning. On our way to discussing deep models, we will also discuss some
more traditional methods.


## Learning
In order to develop a formal mathematical system of learning machines, we need to have
formal measures of how good (or bad) our models are. In machine learning, and optimiza-
tion more generally, we call these objective functions.

## if we want to create learning machines, we need a means of evaluating them
common loss function is squared error,
i.e., the square of the difference between the prediction and the ground truth target.

## What about training?
We learn the best values of our model‚Äôs parameters by
minimizing the loss incurred on a set consisting of some number of examples collected for
training. However, doing well on the training data does not guarantee that we will do well
on unseen data. So we will typically want to split the available data into two partitions:
the training dataset (or training set), for learning model parameters; and the test dataset
(or test set), which is held out for evaluation

training is like test score of a student

## What about scoring too well?
Over time, the model might begin to memorize the
practice questions, appearing to master the topic but faltering when faced with previously
unseen questions on the actual final exam. When a model performs well on the training set
but fails to generalize to unseen data, we say that it is overfitting to the training data.


## How do we optimize?
Once we have got some data source and representation, a model, and a well-defined objec-
tive function, we need an algorithm capable of searching for the best possible parameters
for minimizing the loss function. Example is **gradient descent**

## Types of ML Problems that 

### Supervised
given a dataset containing both features
and labels and asked to produce a model that predicts the labels when given input features.
Sometimes, when the context is clear, we
may use the term examples to refer to a collection of inputs
In probabilistic terms, we typically are interested in estimating the conditional probability
of a label given input features

#### process of learning
the learning process looks something like the following. First, grab a big col-
lection of examples for which the features are known and select from them a random subset,
acquiring the ground truth labels for each. Together, these inputs and corresponding labels comprise the train-
ing set. We feed the training dataset into a supervised learning algorithm, a function that
takes as input a dataset and outputs another function: the learned model. Finally, we can
feed previously unseen inputs to the learned model, using its outputs as predictions of the
corresponding label

#### regression
Answers to the learning problems of *how many* .
The goal is to produce a
model whose predictions closely approximate the actual label values.

#### classifying
Answers to the learning problems of *how much*. 
In classification, we want our model to look at features, 
and then predict to which category (sometimes called a class) among some discrete set
of options, an example belongs

##### Types of classifications
1. **Binary** 
2. **Multiclass**
3. **Hierarchical** (like Linnean hierarchies)
4. **Multi-label/Tagging** - predict classes that are not mutually exclusive

#### Searching (ranking)
The goal is less to determine whether a particular page is relevant for a
query, but rather which, among a set of relevant results, should be shown most prominently
to a particular user.

#### Recommender Systems
Same as search, but emphasis on personalization to specific users. Given such a model, for any given user, we could retrieve the set of objects with the largest
scores, which could then be recommended to the user

### Sequence Learning
Specifically, sequence-to-sequence
learning considers problems where both inputs and outputs consist of variable-length se-
quences. Examples include machine translation and speech-to-text transcription.

### Unsupervised (self supervised) Learning
can train models to ‚Äúfill in the blanks‚Äù by predicting some aspect of the unlabeled data to provide supervision.

### Offline Learning
the learning takes place
after the algorithm is disconnected from the environment, 
The upside is that we can worry about
pattern recognition in isolation, with no concern about complications arising from interac-
tions with a dynamic environment
BUT!
Limitations with remembering, leveraging enviro, competing with enviro, etc.?
These questions raise the problem of distribution shift, where training and test data are
different.

### Reinforcement Learning
machine learning to develop an agent that interacts with an
environment and takes actions,

## Perceptrons and core properties
The alternation of linear and nonlinear processing units, often referred to as layers.
‚Ä¢ The use of the chain rule (also known as backpropagation) for adjusting parameters in
the entire network at once.

Deep learning is the subset
of machine learning concerned with models based on many-layered neural networks. It is
deep in precisely the sense that its models learn many layers of transformations.
