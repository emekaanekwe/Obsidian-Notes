A lot happened, and there was a plethora of information presented at each lab.

##### It's important to fine-tune my note-taking approach so as to solidify understanding

I have the following materials to extract information from:
1. slides
2. lecture talks
3. lab talks
4. books
5. cohorts
6. llms
7. other web resources

Then the tools to use for extraction:
tools:
8. pencils
9. pastel colored pencils
10. colored pens
11. book marker papers
12. keyboard
13. audio
and the following mediums:
14. drawing pad
15. govt. notebook
16. giant drawing sheet
17. obsidian
18. vs code
19. one note browser
20. text editor

##### What I have found to work

**Book-Slides-Drawing Pad**
*Pros* i) rants a solid understanding of the material as I am required to specify exactly what I am writing.
*Cons* i) difficult to navigate through pad to make cognitive links 

**Obsidian-Slides** 
*Pros* i) note taking is quick, and efficient. ii) coding is much quicker. iii) lends itself for easier organization
*Cons* i) difficult to diagram concepts. ii) information sometimes meshes together 

**One Note-Slides**
*Pros*
