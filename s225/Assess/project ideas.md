**Interest Recommender**
	gathers general info about a client, and gives a more holisitic recommendation of things to do/interests

**Martial Technique Analyzer**
	collect data on a specific technique (e.g., a jab), and create a model that can classify whether a person performing the technique is correct.

**ant pheremone tracker**
	mini robot that goes in the direction of where ants go

**Deeper analysis of Bishop's column vectors assumption for linear regression**
	Bishop states that one can safely assume that transposition is a core process of parameter calculating for non-linear regression models. Maybe that's misguided, or a more efficient method is available

**Is there another way that data could be inputted?**
	what is there was a system that could accept a fundamental data structure, that skips additional computation for analyzing the structure?
	
**What if we could leverage ML to minimize loss that contain noise when dealing with small scaled analog computers?**

if scaled too small, they can suffer from higher [noise levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_\(physics\) "Noise (physics)"). Either problem can cause the circuit to produce an incorrect simulation of the physical system. (Modern digital simulations are much more robust to widely varying values of their variables, but are still not entirely immune to these concerns: [floating-point digital calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic "Floating-point arithmetic") support a huge [dynamic range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range "Dynamic range"), but can suffer from imprecision if tiny differences of huge values lead to [numerical instability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_stability "Numerical stability").)
